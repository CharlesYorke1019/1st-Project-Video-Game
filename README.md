# 1st-Project-Video-Game
1st project (video game) inspired by the anime Naruto.

This is my first in depth coding project. I completed this game by myself with a tiny bit of help from YouTube. 
There are definitely problems that can be found within this game as this is my first project,
but when I played it as anyone would play it there were no problems. 
I think its my old computer, but trying to screen record gameplay slowed the game down as a whole.  
As I said this is my first in depth project so there can be problems to be found, but let me know what I should fix if anything.
